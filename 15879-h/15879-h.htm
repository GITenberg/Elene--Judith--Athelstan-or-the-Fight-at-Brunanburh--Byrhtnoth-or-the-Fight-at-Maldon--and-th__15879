<h2><a name="preface" id="preface">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>This translation of the <span class="sc">Elene</span> was made while reading the poem
with a post-graduate student in the session of 1887-88, Zupitza's
second edition being used for the text, which does not differ materially
from that in his third edition (1888). It was completed
before I received a copy of Dr. Weymouth's translation (1888),
from Zupitza's text; but in the revision for publication I have
referred to it, although I cannot always agree with the learned
scholar in his interpretation of certain passages. Grein's text
was, however, used to fill <i>lacun&aelig;</i>, and in the revision the recently
published (1888) Grein-W&uuml;lker text was compared in some passages.
The line-for-line form has been employed, as in my translation
of <span class="sc">B&eacute;owulf</span>; for it has been approved by high authority,
and is unquestionably more serviceable to the student, even if I
have not been able to attain ideal correctness of rhythm. I plead
guilty in advance to any <i>lapsus</i> in that respect, but I strongly
suspect that I have appreciated the difficulty more highly than
my future critics. The <span class="sc">Elene</span> is more suitable than the <span class="sc">B&eacute;owulf</span>
for first reading in Old English poetry on account of its style and
its subject, which make the interpretation considerably easier,
and I concur with K&ouml;rting, in his <i>Grundriss der Geschichte der
Englischen Litteratur</i> (p. 47, 1887): &quot;Die <span class="sc">Elene</span> eignet sich
sowohl wegen ihres anmutigen Inhaltes, als auch, weil sie in der
trefflichen Ausgabe von Zupitza leicht zug&auml;nglich ist, als erste
poetische Lect&uuml;re f&uuml;r Anf&auml;nger im Angels&auml;chsischen.&quot; This statement
is now the stronger for English readers because Zupitza's
text is in course of publication, edited with introduction, notes,
and glossary by Professor Charles W. Kent, of the University of
<a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>
Tennessee. I have appended a few notes which explain themselves,
and have occasionally inserted words in brackets.</p>

<p>The translations of the <span class="sc">Judith</span> and the <span class="sc">Byrhtnoth</span> were
made in regular course of reading with undergraduate classes,
the former in 1886, and the latter in 1887, the texts in Sweet's
&quot;Anglo-Saxon Reader&quot; being used, and compared with those in
Grein and in K&ouml;rner. The text of <span class="sc">Judith</span> is now accessible in
Professor Cook's edition (1888).</p>

<p>The translation of the <span class="sc">Athelstan</span> has been added from
K&ouml;rner's text, compared with Grein and W&uuml;lker, and in certain
passages with Thorpe and Earle. For fuller literary information
than the Introduction provides, the reader is referred to ten
Brink's &quot;Early English Literature,&quot; Kennedy's translation (1883),
and to Morley's &quot;English Writers,&quot; Vol. II. (1888).</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO EDITION OF 1900.</h3>

<p>I have added to this reprint of my &quot;Elene and other Anglo
Saxon Poems&quot; a translation of the <span class="sc">Dream of the Rood</span>, which
has been on hand for several years awaiting a suitable time to see
the light. A brief Introduction to the poem has been prefixed,
which, doubtless, leaves much to be desired, but it is all that
the translator now has time for, and I must refer to the works
mentioned for fuller information and discussion. With thanks
for past consideration, and the hope that this addition has made
the book more acceptable, I entrust it again to indulgent readers.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO EDITION OF 1911.</h3>

<p>I have read over carefully these translations with a view to
another reprint, which the publishers find necessary, but I have
not compared them again with the texts used. I have corrected
a few typographical errors of little importance.</p>

<p>For the bibliography I would refer to Brandl's <i>Sonderausgabe
aus der zweiten Auflage von Paul's Grundriss der germanischen
Philologie</i> (Strassburg, 1908), in which I find noted Holthausen's
edition of the <span class="sc">Elene</span> (Heidelberg, 1905), but I have not seen it.</p>

<p>I take advantage of this opportunity to say that my translation
of <span class="sc">B&eacute;owulf</span>, of which the last reprint was issued in 1910, is not
in <i>prose</i>, as some have misconceived it, but it is in the same
metrical form as the translations in the present volume,&mdash;an
accentual metre in rough imitation of the original. I agree
with Professor Gummere and others that this is a better form
for the translation of Old English poetry than plain prose. It
was approved by the late Professor Child nearly <i>thirty</i> years ago,
as noted in the Preface to the second edition of my translation
of B&Eacute;OWULF, January, 1885.</p>

<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>In presenting to the public the following translations of the
Old English (Anglo-Saxon) poems, <span class="sc">Elene, Judith, Athelstan,
Byrhtnoth</span>, and <span class="sc">The Dream of the Rood</span>, it is desirable to
prefix a brief account of them for the information of the general
reader.</p>

<p>I. The <span class="sc">Elene</span>, or Helena, is a poem on the expedition of the
Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, the first Christian
emperor, to Palestine in search of the true cross, and its successful
issue. The medi&aelig;val legend of the Finding of the Cross
is given in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> under date of May 4, assigned by
the Church to the commemoration of St. Helena's marvellous discovery.
The Latin work is the Life of St. Quiriacus, or Cyriacus,
Bishop of Jerusalem, that is, the Judas of the poem. It has been
usually thought that the Old English poet used this Life as his
source; but Gl&ouml;de, in a recent volume of <i>Anglia</i> (IX. 271 ff.), has
given reasons for thinking that the poet used some other Latin
text. He rejects ten Brink's conjecture that the legend of Elene
had come to England in a Greek form. As to the author of the
poem, we know his name, but very little else about him. He has
left us his name, imbedded in runic letters as an acrostic, in the
last canto of the poem, <i>q.v.</i> These letters spell the word CYNEWULF;
but who was Cynewulf? The question is hard to answer,
and has given rise to much discussion, which cannot be gone into
here. A good summary of it will be found in W&uuml;lker's <i>Grundriss
zur Geschichte der Angels&auml;chsischen Litteratur</i> (p. 147 ff., 1885), an
indispensable work for students of Old English literature. The
<a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv"></a>
old view, propounded in the infancy of Anglo-Saxon studies, and
held by Kemble, Thorpe, and, doubtfully, Wright, that he was the
Abbot of Peterborough and Bishop of Winchester (992-1008), has
been abandoned by all scholars, so far as I know, except Professor
Earle of Oxford (see his &quot;Anglo-Saxon Literature,&quot; p. 228). The
later view of Leo, Dietrich, Grein and Rieger, our chief authorities,
that he was a Northumbrian, and of Dietrich and Grein, that he
was Bishop of Lindisfarne (737-780), has more to be said for it.
Sweet and ten Brink also hold that he was a Northumbrian of the
eighth century, but not the Bishop of Lindisfarne, while W&uuml;lker
regards him as a West-Saxon. Professor Henry Morley, in the
current edition of his &quot;English Writers,&quot; has devoted a chapter
(Vol. II. Chap. IX., 1888) to Cynewulf, and virtually concludes
that we know nothing about him except that he was a poet and
probably lived in the eighth century. We shall not go far wrong
in regarding him as a Northumbrian poet of the eighth century,
possibly the Bishop of Lindisfarne, even though his works remain
to us only in the West-Saxon dialect. As in the <span class="sc">Elene</span>, so in the
<span class="sc">Christ</span> and the <span class="sc">Juliana</span>, Cynewulf has left us his name, hence all
agree in ascribing to him these poems at least. To these some of
the <span class="sc">Riddles</span>, if not all, are usually added, but this is now contested.
Other poems, as the <span class="sc">Guthlac, Ph&oelig;nix, Christ's Descent
into Hell, Andreas, Dream of the Rood</span>, and several
other shorter poems, have been ascribed to him with more or less
probability, and very recently Sarrazin (in <i>Anglia</i>, IX. 515 ff.)
would credit him with the authorship of even the <span class="sc">B&eacute;owulf</span>(!).
We might as well assign to him, as has been suggested, all the
poems in the two great manuscripts, the Exeter Book and the Vercelli
Book, and be done with it. It is desirable that his authorship
of the <span class="sc">Dream of the Rood</span>, which ten Brink and Sweet assign to
him, but W&uuml;lker rejects, should be proved or disproved; for with
this is connected the question of his Northumbrian origin, and
<a name="pagexv" id="pagexv"></a>
some lines from this poem have been inscribed in the Northumbrian
dialect on the Ruthwell Cross in Dumfriesshire.</p>

<p>However it may be, a poet named Cynewulf wrote the <span class="sc">Elene</span>,
and thereby left us one of the finest Old English poems that time
has preserved, on a subject that was of great interest to Christian
Europe. A collection of &quot;Legends of the Holy Rood&quot; has been
issued by the Early English Text Society (ed. Morris, 1871), from
the Anglo-Saxon period to Caxton's translation of the <i>Legenda
Aurea</i>; but they are arranged without system, and no study has
been made of the date and relation of the several forms of the
story. If Cynewulf made use of the Latin Life of Cyriacus in the
<i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, he expanded his source considerably and showed
great skill and originality in his treatment of the subject, as may
be seen by comparing the translation with the Latin text in Zupitza's
third edition of the <span class="sc">Elene</span> (1888), or in Professor Kent's
forthcoming American edition, after Zupitza. The Old English
text was discovered by a German scholar, Dr. F. Blume, at Vercelli,
Italy, in 1822, and the manuscript has since become well
known as the Vercelli Book (cf. W&uuml;lker's <i>Grundriss</i>, p. 237 ff.).
A reasonable conjecture as to how this MS. reached Vercelli may
be found in Professor Cook's pamphlet, &quot;Cardinal Guala and the
Vercelli Book.&quot; A Bibliography of the <span class="sc">Elene</span> will be found in
W&uuml;lker, Zupitza, and Kent. English translations have been made
by Kemble, in his edition of the Codex Vercellensis (1856), and
very recently by Dr. R.F. Weymouth, Acton, England, after Zupitza's
text (privately printed, 1888). A German translation will
be found in Grein's <i>Dichtungen der Angelsachsen</i> (II. 104 ff., 1859),
and of lines 1-275 in K&ouml;rner's <i>Einleitung in das Studium des Angels&auml;chsischen</i>
(p. 147 ff., 1880). A good summary of the poem is
given in Earle's &quot;Anglo-Saxon Literature&quot; (p. 234 ff., 1884), and
a briefer one in Morley's &quot;English Writers&quot; (II. 196 ff.).</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Elene</span> is conceded to be Cynewulf's best poem, and ten
<a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi"></a>
Brink remarks of the <span class="sc">Andreas</span> and the <span class="sc">Elene</span>: &quot;In these Cynewulf
appears, perhaps, at the summit of his art&quot; (p. 58, Kennedy's
translation). The last canto is a personal epilogue, of a sad and
reflective character, evidently appended after the poem proper was
concluded. This may be the last work of the poet, and there is
good reason for ten Brink's view (p. 59) that &quot;not until the writing
of the <span class="sc">Elene</span> had Cynewulf entirely fulfilled the task he had
set himself in consequence of his vision of the cross. Hence he
recalls, at the close of the poem, the greatest moment of his life,
and praises the divine grace that gave him deeper knowledge, and
revealed to him the art of song.&quot;</p>

<p>II. The <span class="sc">Judith</span> is a fragment, but a very torso of Hercules.
The first nine cantos, nearly three-fourths of the poem, are irretrievably
lost, so that we have left but the last three cantos with a
few lines of the ninth. The story is from the apocryphal book of
Judith, and the part remaining corresponds to chapters XII. 10 to
XVI. 1, but the poet has failed to translate the grand thanksgiving
of Judith in the sixteenth chapter. The story of Judith and
Holofernes is too well known to need narration. The poet, doubtless,
followed the Latin Vulgate, as we have no reason to think
that a knowledge of Greek was a common possession among Old
English poets; but, as Professor Cook says, &quot;the order of events is
not that of the original narrative. Many transpositions have been
made in the interest of condensation and for the purpose of enhancing
the dramatic liveliness of the story.&quot;</p>

<p>The Old English text is found in the same manuscript with the
<span class="sc">B&eacute;owulf</span> (Cotton, Vitellius, A, xv.), and, to my mind, this poem
reminds the reader more of the vigor and fire of <span class="sc">B&eacute;owulf</span> than
does any other Old English poem; but its author is unknown. It
has been assigned by some scholars to the tenth century, which is
rather late for it; but Professor Cook has given reasons for thinking
that it may have been written in the second half of the ninth century
<a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii"></a>
in honor of Judith, the step-mother of King Alfred. It was
first printed as prose by Thwaites at the close of his &quot;Heptateuch,
Book of Job, and Gospel of Nicodemus&quot; (1698), and has been often
reprinted, its shortness and excellence making it a popular piece
for inclusion in Anglo-Saxon Readers. A most complete edition
has been recently (1888) issued by Professor Albert S. Cook, with
an excellent introduction, a translation, and a glossary. A Bibliography
is given by Professor Cook (pp. 71-73), and by W&uuml;lker
(<i>Grundriss</i>, p. 140 ff.). To the translations therein enumerated
may be added the one in Morley's &quot;English Writers&quot; (II. 180 ff.).
Professor Cook has also given (pp. lxix-lxxii) the testimonies of
scholars to the worth of this poem. To these the attention of the
reader is especially called. The <span class="sc">Judith</span> has been treated by both
ten Brink and W&uuml;lker as belonging to the Caedmon circle, but the
former well says (p. 47): &quot;This fragment produces an impression
more like that of the national epos than is the case with any other
religious poetry of that epoch;&quot; and Sweet (Reader, p. 157) regards
it as belonging &quot;to the culminating point of the Old Northumbrian
literature, combining as it does the highest dramatic and constructive
power with the utmost brilliance of language and metre.&quot;</p>

<p>III. The <span class="sc">Athelstan</span>, or Fight at Brunanburh, is found in four
manuscripts of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and in Wheloc's edition
(1643), printed from a MS. that was burnt in the unfortunate fire
among the Cottonian manuscripts (1731). It is entered under the
year 937 in all but one MS., where it occurs under 938. The poem
gives a brief, but graphic, description of the fight between King
Athelstan and his brother Edmund on the one side, and Constantine
and his Scots aided by Anlaf and his Danes, or Northmen, on
the other, in which fight the Saxons were completely victorious.
The poem will be found in all editions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;
from Wheloc to Earle (1865), and has been repeatedly reprinted,
its brevity causing it to be often included as a specimen
<a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii"></a>
of Old English, but it is omitted in Sweet's Reader. A Bibliography
will be found in W&uuml;lker's <i>Grundriss</i> (p. 339 ff.). To the
English translations there mentioned,&mdash;which include a poetical
one by Lord Tennyson, after a prose translation by his son in the
Contemporary Review for November, 1876,&mdash;may be added the
prose translation by Kennedy in ten Brink (p. 91) and the rhythmical
one by Professor Morley in his &quot;English Writers&quot; (II. 316-17).
ten Brink thinks that the poem was not written by an eye-witness,
and says (p. 92): &quot;The poem lacks the epic perception
and direct power of the folk-song as well as invention. The
patriotic enthusiasm, however, upon which it is borne, the lyrical
strain which pervades it, yield their true effect. The rich resources
derived from the national epos are here happily utilised, and the
pure versification and brilliant style of the whole stir our admiration.&quot;
It well serves to diversify and enliven the usually dry
annals of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&quot; and cannot be spared in
the great dearth of poetry of this period.</p>

<p>IV. The <span class="sc">Byrhtnoth</span>, or Fight at Maldon, relates in vigorous
verse the contest between the Saxons, led by the Ealdorman Byrhtnoth,
and the Danes at the river Panta, near Maldon in Essex, in
which the Danes were victorious and Byrhtnoth was slain. The
incident is mentioned in four manuscripts of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle&quot; under the year 991, but one gives it under 993. The
MS. in which the poem was contained was unfortunately burnt
in the great fire above-mentioned (1731); but Thomas Hearne, the
antiquary, had fortunately printed it, as prose, in his edition, of
the Chronicle of John of Glastonbury (1726); hence this is now
our sole authority for the text, which is defective at both the beginning
and the end. The poem has been highly esteemed by
scholars, and is a very valuable relic of late tenth century literature.
It has been often reprinted, and translated several times in
whole or in part. Grein does not translate either the <span class="sc">Athelstan</span>
<a name="pagexix" id="pagexix"></a>
or the <span class="sc">Byrhtnoth</span>. K&ouml;rner translates it in full, and so does
Zernial in his Program &quot;Das Lied von Byrhtnoth's Fall&quot; (1882).
This monograph contains the fullest study of the poem that has
been made. It is translated into English, with some omissions,
by Kennedy in ten Brink (pp. 93-96); it is barely mentioned by
Earle (p. 147), and a summary of it is given by Morley in &quot;English
Writers&quot; (II. 319-320). A Bibliography will be found in
W&uuml;lker's <i>Grundriss</i> (pp. 344-5). An edition of both <span class="sc">Athelstan</span>
and <span class="sc">Byrhtnoth</span> has been long announced in the &quot;Library of
Anglo-Saxon Poetry,&quot; but it has not yet appeared.
<a name="FNanchor_1a_1" id="FNanchor_1a_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1a_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Sweet says of the <span class="sc">Byrhtnoth</span> (Reader, p. 138): &quot;Although the poem does
not show the high technical finish of the older works, it is full of
dramatic power and warm feeling&quot;; and ten Brink, with more
enthusiasm, calls it (p. 96) &quot;one of the pearls of Old English
poetry, full, as it is, of dramatic life, and fidelity of an eye-witness.
Its deep feeling throbs in the clear and powerful portrayal.&quot; He
recognizes, however, &quot;the tokens of metrical decline, of the dissolution
of ancient art-forms.&quot;</p>

<p>V. The <span class="sc">Dream of the Rood</span> is found in the Vercelli manuscript.
W&uuml;lker's <i>Grundriss</i> gives the literature of the subject to
the time of its publication (1885). Soon afterwards Morley's
&quot;English Writers,&quot; Vol. II., appeared (1888), in which an English
translation is given (pp. 237-241); also Stopford Brooke, in his
&quot;History of Early English Literature&quot; (1892), has given an account
of the poem, with partial translation and epitome (pp. 436-443).
(See also p. 337 and pp. 384-386 for further notice.) The poem
is very briefly mentioned by Trautmann in his monograph on
Cynewulf (1898, p. 40). There are some very interesting questions
connected with the poem which cannot be discussed here. Was
it by Cynewulf? On the affirmative side we find Dietrich, Rieger,
Grein, ten Brink, D'Ham, and Sweet. On the negative, W&uuml;lker,
Ebert, Trautmann, Stephens, Morley, Brooke, and others. Pacius,
<a name="pagexx" id="pagexx"></a>
who edited the text, with a German translation, in 1873, thinks
that we know nothing about the poet. Brooke has propounded a
theory, previously adumbrated by the editors of the <i>Corpus Poeticum
Boreale</i>, Vigfusson and Powell, that an older poem, possibly
of C&aelig;dmonian origin, as shown by the long six-accent lines, has
been worked over by Cynewulf, with additions, and that it is &quot;his
last work&quot; (p. 440). Certain lines of the poem, in the Northumbrian
dialect, are found on the Ruthwell Cross, which fact complicates
the question of origin. These are compared by Brooke
(p. 337). The other upholders of the Cynewulfian authorship think
that this Dream, occurring in the early part of Cynewulf's religious
life, led to the longer and more highly finished poem, the <span class="sc">Elene</span>,
written near the close of his life. The questions of the relationship
of the poem to the Ruthwell Cross and to the <span class="sc">Elene</span> deserve
further discussion. With these is connected the question of date,
and the poem has been placed all the way from 700 to 800 A.D.,
even a little before and a little after, possibly 675 to 825 A.D., so
as yet there is no common agreement. The similarity of thought
in the personal epilogue (II. 122 ff.) to the epilogue of the <span class="sc">Elene</span>
(II. 1237 ff.) is striking, and they may be compared by the curious
reader. The translation is made from the Grein-W&uuml;lker text
(Vol. II., pp. 116-125), with emendations from others, as seen
in the notes. All can agree with Kemble (<i>Codex Vercellensis</i>, Part
II., p. ix) that &quot;it is in some respects the most striking of all the
Anglo-Saxon remains, inasmuch as a departure from the mere
conventional style of such compositions is very perceptible in it.
It contains some passages of real poetical beauty, and a good deal
of fancy.&quot; Brooke says (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 443): &quot;This is the last of
the important poems of the eighth century. It is good, but not
very good. The older part, if my conjecture be right, is the
best, and its reworking by Cynewulf has so broken it up that its
dignity is much damaged. The shaping is rude, but the imagination
<a name="pagexxi" id="pagexxi"></a>
has indeed shaped it.&quot; ten Brink says (p. 53): &quot;Cynewulf
himself has immortalized this vision in a poem, giving utterance
to an irrepressible emotion, but still exhibiting the delicate lines
of a beautifully designed composition.&quot; The other Germans are
usually so taken up with technical and mechanical questions that
they leave no room for &aelig;sthetic considerations. Whether Cynewulf
wrote the poem or not,&mdash;and the probabilities favor his
authorship, though we may not hesitate to say with Morley, &quot;I
don't know,&quot;&mdash;it is certainly the work of a gifted Christian poet,
who reverences the cross as the means of the redemption of
mankind.</p>

<p>This brief Introduction will, it is hoped, be sufficient to interest
the reader in the accompanying translations of some of the finest
pieces of Old English poetry that remain to us from the eighth,
ninth, and tenth centuries. The earlier period was the golden
age of Old English poetry in the Northumbrian dialect, which
poetry, there is good reason to think, was copied into the West-Saxon
dialect, and it now remains to us only in that form; for,
when the Northmen harried Northumbria, destroyed its monasteries,
massacred its inhabitants, and settled in its homes, manuscripts
perished, and the light of learning in Western Europe was
extinguished. It is sufficient to recall King Alfred's oft-quoted
lament, in the Preface to his translation of Pope Gregory's
&quot;Pastoral Care,&quot; to realize the position held by Northumbria
in respect to culture, and when learning was restored in Wessex
by the efforts of the king himself, and poetry again revived, it
shone but by a reflected light. Still we should treasure all that
remains, and the Old English language should be at least as well
known as Latin is now, and should occupy as prominent a position
in education and general culture. Until that millennial period
arrives, translations of Old English poems may not be without
service.<a name="pagexxii" id="pagexxii"></a></p>

<span>Steadfast they stood; strengthened them Byrhtnoth,<br /></span>
<span>Bade that each youth of battle should think<br /></span>
<span>He wh&oacute; on the Danes glory would gain.<br /></span>
<span>Went then a war-brave, his weapon uplifted,</span><span class="linenum">130</span><br />
<span>His shield for defence, and strode towards the chief;<br /></span>
<span>So earnest he went, the earl to the churl:<br /></span>
<span>Each for the other of evil was thinking.<br /></span>
<span>Sent then the seaman his spear from the south<br /></span>
<span>That wounded w&aacute;s the warrior's lord;</span><span class="linenum">135</span><br />
<span>Then he shoved with his shield that the shaft in two broke,<br /></span>
<span>And the spear was shivered; so sprang it back.<br /></span>
<span>Enraged was the warrior: with his spear he thrust<br /></span>
<span>The wiking proud, who the wound him gave.<br /></span>
<span>Wise was the warrior; he let his spear pierce</span><span class="linenum">140</span><br />
<span>Through the neck of the youth; his hand it guided<br /></span>
<span>So that h&eacute; his foe of life deprived.<br /></span>
<span>Then he another speedily shot,<br /></span>
<span>That the byrnie burst; in breast was he wounded<br /></span>
<span>Through the ring&egrave;d mail; there stood in his heart</span><span class="linenum">145</span><br />
<a name="page65" id="page65"></a>
<span>The poisonous point. The earl was the gladder;<br /></span>
<span>Laughed the proud man, to his Maker gave thanks<br /></span>
<span>For the work of that day that the Lord him gave.<br /></span>
<span>Then let one of warriors a dart from his hands,<br /></span>
<span>Fly from his fist, that forth it went</span><span class="linenum">150</span><br />
<span>Thr&oacute;ugh that noble thane of &AElig;thelred.<br /></span>
<span>There stood by his side a youth not grown,<br /></span>
<span>A boy in the fight, wh&oacute; very boldly<br /></span>
<span>Drew from the warrior the bloody spear,<br /></span>
<span>The son of Wulfstan, Wulfm&aelig;r the young;</span><span class="linenum">155</span><br />
<span>He let the hard weapon fly back again;<br /></span>
<span>The point in-pierced, that on earth he lay<br /></span>
<span>Who erst his lord strongly had struck.<br /></span>
<span>Went then an armored man to the earl,<br /></span>
<span>He would the warrior's jewels fetch back,</span><span class="linenum">160</span><br />
<span>Armor and rings and sword well-adorned.<br /></span>
<span>Then Byrhtnoth drew his sword from its sheath,<br /></span>
<span>Broad and brown-edged, and on byrnie he struck:<br /></span>
<span>Too quickly him hindered one of the seamen,<br /></span>
<span>When he of the earl the arm had wounded;</span><span class="linenum">165</span><br />
<span>Fell then to earth the fallow-hilt sword:<br /></span>
<span>He might not hold the hardened brand,<br /></span>
<span>His weapon wield. Yet the word he spake,<br /></span>
<span>The hoary hero the youths encouraged,<br /></span>
<span>Bade forwards go his good companions:</span><span class="linenum">170</span><br />
<span>He might not on foot longer stand firm;<br /></span>
<span>He looked up to heaven, [the earl exclaimed:<a name="FNanchor_17_94" id="FNanchor_17_94"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_94" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>]<br /></span>

<span>For all those joys that on earth I experienced:<br /></span>

<span>Then hewed him down the heathen hinds,<br /></span>
<span>And both the warriors, who by him stood,<br /></span>
<span>&AElig;lfnoth and Wulfm&aelig;r both lay down dead,<br /></span>
<span>Beside their lord gave up their lives.<br /></span>
<span>Then bowed they from battle who there would not be;</span><span class="linenum">185</span><br />

<span>Lo! choicest of dreams I will relate,<br /></span>
<span>What dream I dreamt in middle of night<br /></span>
<span>When mortal men reposed in rest.<br /></span>
<span>Methought I saw a wondrous wood<br /></span>
<span>Tower aloft with light bewound,</span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span>Brightest of trees; that beacon was all<br /></span>
<span>Begirt with gold; jewels were standing<br /></span>
<span>Four<a name="FNanchor_1_101" id="FNanchor_1_101"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_101" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at surface of earth, likewise were there five<br /></span>
<span>Above on the shoulder-brace. All angels of God beheld it,<br /></span>
<span>Fair through future ages; 'twas no criminal's cross indeed,</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span>But holy spirits beheld it there,<br /></span>
<span>Men upon earth, all this glorious creation.<br /></span>
<span>Strange was that victor-tree, and stained with sins was I,<br /></span>
<span>With foulness defiled. I saw the glorious tree<br /></span>
<span>With vesture<a name="FNanchor_2_102" id="FNanchor_2_102"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_102" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> adorned winsomely shine,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
